Hello, here is the notebooks for the FNL project.
The protein for me is ADRA1B, which play a role in Central Nervous System. I collected data from DTC, EXCAPE and ChEMBL to analyse how much of paticular inhibitory compounds is needed to inhibit the protein by 50%, and use Random forest model to predict pXC50 value. More information is listed below.
